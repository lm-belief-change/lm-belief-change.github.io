# LM-belief-change
This repository contains the code for paper [Accumulating Context Changes the Beliefs of Language Models](xxx)


## News
- **[2025/10/20]** Initial release.

## Experimental Setting
<img src="./teaser.png" width="1000px"></img>
The figure above shows our framework for measuring changes in model's stated belief and behavior. (1) Evaluating the initial stated belief and behavior. (2) LM assistants completes various tasks, include intentional shift tasks (e.g. debate, persuasion) and non-intentional shift tasks (e.g. research and in-depth reading). (3) Evaluating the post-task belief and behavior.


## Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
