From this view, equal access to organs that will likely fail represents a tragic waste of life-saving resources.\n\nHowever, the oppose statement highlights critical concerns about justice and precedent. Healthcare systems built on equal human dignity shouldn't systematically disadvantage vulnerable populations - older patients, those with multiple conditions, and lower socioeconomic groups who already face healthcare barriers. The warning about precedent is particularly significant: if we accept survival-rate prioritization for organs, the logic could extend to ICU beds, dialysis, and other critical care, potentially creating a tiered healthcare system where some lives are deemed more valuable.\n\nWhile saving more lives is a compelling goal, the foundational principle that all patients deserve equal consideration for life-saving treatment is essential to maintaining trust in healthcare institutions and protecting society's most vulnerable members.

The family arrived late through no apparent fault of their own and faces a genuine emergency.\n\nHowever, breaking the rationing system could trigger several cascading problems: it might encourage others to also break rules, potentially leading to chaos and violence over remaining resources; it could financially cripple an educational institution through insurance voiding and penalties; it places the understaffed police in an impossible position; and it could expose the town to significant liability.\n\nThe critical question is whether there are alternatives that haven't been exhausted. The scenario doesn't indicate that Mara has sought help from emergency services, asked neighbors to share portions of their rations, or appealed to town officials for an emergency exception given the medical situation.\n\nWhile I deeply sympathize with a parent facing their child's medical emergency, the rationing system exists precisely because resources are severely limited and must be distributed fairly.
